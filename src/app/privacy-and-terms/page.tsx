        <p>
          Privacy is important to us at SciQuel. We hold ourselves to a high
          standard as an independent, nonprofit dedicated to sharing science to
          the public. Please note that this policy may be updated from time to
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have developed our site, applications, and related services so that
          you can visit without identifying yourself or revealing any personal
          information to us. We do not track visitors to our site as they access
          other sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do choose to provide us with your personally identifying
          information, SciQuel is the only organization that has access to the
          information we collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          SciQuel does not share, trade, sell, or otherwise release personal
          information to any third parties. This includes all information that
          is obtained both online and offline. We do not disclose donor
          information without explicit consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you submit the contact form on our site, we store your IP address
          and the information you provide. When you submit the newsletter
          subscription form on our site, we store your email and, should you
          provide it, your name.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use reasonable measures to help protect the information we possess.
          You should understand that that no data storage system or data
          transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely
          secure. You provide us with this data at your own risk. To the fullest
          extent permitted by applicable law, SciQuel does not accept liability
          for unintentional disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our site and services are designed for and targeted to United States
          audiences and are governed in accordance with United States law. If
          you are located outside of the U.S., by sending us your data you
          consent to its transfer to and storage within the United States.
          Protecting the privacy of young children is important to us. Our site
          and services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as
          required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children. If you learn that your child has provided
          us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us.
          If we learn that we have collected any personal information in
          violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete
          such information.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the site and services or providing personal information to
          us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically
          regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues related to such
          use. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to
          notify you electronically by posting a notice, by mail or by sending
          an email to you. We may share your information in connection with a
          substantial corporate transaction, such as an acquisition, a merger,
          consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of the bankruptcy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we believe it is reasonably necessary, we may read, preserve, and
          disclose your information to comply with the law, including to respond
          to law enforcement; to protect and defend ourselves or others; and to
          stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical, or legally
          actionable. If we receive a subpoena, warrant, discovery order, or
          other request or order from a law enforcement agency, court, other
          governmental entity, or litigant that seeks your data, we will make
          reasonable attempts to direct the requesting party to seek the data
          directly from you. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any
          legal defenses or objections that you have to a third party’s
          (including a government’s) request to disclose your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing SciQuel’s site, applications, or other services, you
          agree to be legally bound by and comply with this policy. If you do
          not agree to comply with this policy, you are not authorized to use
          this site.
