                    Further remarkable examples include insects bearing an
                    uncanny resemblance to bird droppings (Hebert 1974) or fish
                    resembling fallen leaves on a stream bed (Sazima et al.

                    occurs in a range of, in particular, aquatic species
                    (Johnsen 2001; Carvalho et al. 2006). Examples such as leaf
                    mimicry in butterflies helped convince Wallace (1889), for
                    example, of the power of natural selection. Other strategies
                    may even stretch to the use of bioluminescence to hide
                    shadows generated in aquatic environments (Johnsen et al.
                    2004), and include ‘decorating’ the body with items from the
                    general environment, such as do some crabs (Hultgren &
                    Stachowicz 2008).

                    Although RNAs are capable of catalyzing some reactions, most
                    biological reactions are catalyzed by proteins. In the
                    absence of enzymatic catalysis, most biochemical reactions
                    are so slow that they would not occur under the mild
                    conditions of temperature and pressure that are compatible
                    with life.

                      One of the most studied bacterial surface molecules is the

                    Much of the initial attention LPS received in the early
                    1900s was owed to its ability to stimulate the immune
                    system, for which the glycolipid was commonly known as
                    endotoxin.

                      lipopolysaccharide performs several functions in
                      Gram-negative bacteria.
                    </DictionarySentence>{" "}
                    The most fundamental function of LPS is to serve as a major
                    structural component of the OM. Perhaps not surprisingly,
                    LPS is an essential component of the cell envelope in most,
                    though interestingly not all, Gram-negative bacteria (4). In
                    addition, LPS molecules transform the OM into an effective
                    permeability barrier against small, hydrophobic molecules
                    that can otherwise cross phospholipid bilayers, making
                    Gram-negative bacteria innately resistant to many
                    antimicrobial compounds (5, 6). LPS can also play a crucial
                    role in bacteria-host interactions by modulating responses
                    by the host immune system.

                    themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the
                    reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without
